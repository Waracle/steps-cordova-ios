# Step Cordova iOS

Adds support for cordova-based iOS projects at [bitrise.io](https.bitrise.io).
More info at [https://cordova.apache.org](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html).

## How to use this Step

Can be run directly with the [bitrise CLI](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise),
just `git clone` this repository, `cd` into it's folder in your Terminal/Command Line
and call `bitrise run test`.

*Check the `bitrise.yml` file for required inputs which have to be
added to your `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file!*
